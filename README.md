# Overall Project Template

## Description
This is a folder hierarchy that can be used to both, keep your project organized and import directly (just bring in the top level "Media" folder) into DaVinci Resolve or Adobe Premiere. The "Production" and "Project Files" folders don't necessarily need to be brought into your NLE.

## Instructions
1. [Download Latest Release](https://github.com/lsuxrstudio/overall-project-template/archive/refs/tags/v1.0.0.zip)
2. Unzip
3. Move the folder to the location you want to store your production content.
4. Start dumping footage and editing content.

## Considerations
* Look in the folder for descriptions of what goes there.
* Think about using a cloud storage service that you can _make availble offline_ certain folders while you work on the project and then _make availble online_ when you're done.
* Look here for a workflow guide that uses this project template (TBA).
